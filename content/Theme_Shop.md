title = 'Theme Shop'
+++

The Theme Shop was added in [9.0.0-20](9.0.0-20 "wikilink"), which allows users to purchase [Home Menu Theme](Home_Menu/Themes "wikilink"). The shop file structure is based on the [BOSS](BOSS "wikilink") file. When the shop starts booting, it requests a top file from <https://npdl.cdn.nintendowifi.net/p01/nsa/dMtiFHzm5OOf0y2O/thmtop/><countrycode>/<language>/top. Because Nintendo has closed the Shop alongside [eShop](eShop "wikilink") on March 27, 2023, the Top file was edited to only have "New Themes" as an option.

## Available Themes Info

After the top file, when you click any Theme Category or All themes, the 3DS Downloads the available themes for the country on <https://npfl.c.app.nintendowifi.net/p01/filelist/dMtiFHzm5OOf0y2O/thmdtls?c=><countrycode>&l<language>=&a3=<indexCount>
